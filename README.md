# A-small-ml-library
This repo contains implementation of popular machine learning algorithms. It provides interface similar to scikit-learn.
This library aims to provide flexibility for experiment with ML algorithms. (This is still in progress, more algorithms will be added soon.)
Models can be trained using "fit" function. And to predict values "predict" can be used.
